1. Write a test using Jasmine
    All tests are written inside of the spec folder (Initialise jasmine project by typing: jasmine init (expect spec folder to be created))

2. Create a first jasmine test by creating a following file (touch): touch test.spec.js within the spec folder
        
        WHY xxx.spec.js? When Jasmine is looking for test files, it identifies them by the .spec.js in the filename.
        If the .spec.js does not exist as part of the file, Jasmine will ignore it :)

        The super basic content of the xxx.spec.js

        describe('hello world', function () {
        it('hello test', function () {
        });
    });

3. Run Tests in Jasmine
    Go back to the root directory
    type: jasmine and press enter
